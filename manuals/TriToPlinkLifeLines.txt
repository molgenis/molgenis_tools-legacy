Convert from TriTyper to Plink TPED+TFAM format while making a subselection of individuals and appending 
phenotypes to the FAM file. Additionally:
The subselection using the first column of the 'slice' file (pseudonymisation+pheno) is made on 
Individuals.txt, but the output pseudonymized individual names are retrieved from the second column.
The phenotypes for the FAM file are now the third column.
See: examples/TriToPlinkLifeLines-exampleSubsetPseudo.txt

You can also specify whether you want to output:
- Just the TPED file, use P
- Just the TFAM file, use F
- Both TPED and TFAM, use B

Example usage:
java -jar TriToPlinkLifeLines.jar F BrainsetTriTyper/ myresults subsetpseudo.txt
java -jar -Xmx1g TriToPlinkLifeLines.jar B LifeLinesTriTyper/ study9 subsetpseudo_userX.txt
