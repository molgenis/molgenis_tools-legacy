A tiny WAR file that acts as a service to tell a user which exposed ('real') IP is requesting it. Simply deploy on Tomcat and you're done.

How it works:

* Deploy on Tomcat (i.e. just drag into the /webapps folder)
* Access the service by requesting this URL: {server}{port}/user/ip, for example http://gbicdev.target.rug.nl:8080/user/ip
* The service will now tell you what IP adress was used for this request
* Very handy when you need to know the IP adress of your application when running a process on another location, e.g. cluster computation via xQTL workbench
