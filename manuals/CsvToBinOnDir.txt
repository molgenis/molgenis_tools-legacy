Convert from CSV files to xQTL binaries on a whole directory at once:
java -jar CsvToBinOnDir.jar data.txt

The argument (data.txt) is the data description file location.
This is a MOLGENIS/XGAP format file for 'Data' entities.

In this file, use at least the following column headers:
	name, investigation_Name, targetType, featureType, valueType, storage

The input and output files are all read in/write out in the directory where the JAR is located.
The names of these files are based on the 'Data' name field.
So: for each 'Data' name X, we expect a file called X.txt which will be converted to X.bin, all in your current working directory.
